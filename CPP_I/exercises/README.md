# C++ Portfolio

A personal portfolio of C++ development work, including practice exercises, data-structure implementations, OOP concepts, and real projects. Organized for readability and easy navigation. Updated regularly as I progress.

## 📁 Repository Structure
```
cpp-portfolio/
├─ projects/         # Full applications (systems, tools, games)
├─ exercises/        # Small practice programs
├─ data-structures/  # Linked lists, stacks, queues, searching, etc.
└─ README.md
```

## ✅ What's Included

- **Exercises:** Small focused programs practicing C++ fundamentals  
- **Data Structures:** Implementations of common DS (LinkedList, Stack, Searching…)  
- **Projects:** Larger, showcase-worthy applications built using OOP and clean design principles  
- **Continuous Updates:** More projects and modules will be added as I progress  

## 🛠️ How to Run Code

Most exercises and data-structure files are single `.cpp` files and can be compiled using:

**g++ (Linux/Mac):**
g++ filename.cpp -o program
./program


**Visual Studio:**  
Open the `.sln` file inside a project folder and build/run the project normally.
